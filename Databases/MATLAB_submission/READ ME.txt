The code and the needed files are stored in 'MATLAB submission' folder.

Requirements:
1. Latest FLASH player
2. Video camera (check in the m files - 2nd line(both of the files) - that the video adapter selected is the one 
	used by your machine)
3. Image acquisition and processing toolbox

TO RUN THE SYSTEM:

1. Make sure you have the att_faces.zip (AT&T database) unziped and avaliable in the folder containing the m file.
	(They should be in the format of 's1' to 's40'.)
2. Run the Project_cold_v4.m
3. Select the appropriate option from the GUI. (speed depends on the hardware but overall patience is required ;p


TO ADD A FACE:

1. To add a face run the database_update_v3.m OR run the GUI using Project_vold_v4.m and then click on ADD.
	(whenever we add a face the w.mat files get recompiled. This file is used by the main m file. 
	The original w.mat contains faces from author's directory of 60 faces folders.)
